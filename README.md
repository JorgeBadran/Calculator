# Calculator Projects

This project was made in Python (Version 3.7) using the Tkinter library is a calculator that helps us perform arithmetic operations.


To run the program you must follow the following instructions:

´´´
sh
source env/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
cd Calculator
python3 calculator.py
```

To convert the program into a desktop application we must convert the file to .exe, we do this in the following way:  
 
´´´
sh
let's go to the terminal
We go to the folder where the project is
We execute the following command:
pyinstaller --clean --onefile --windowed calculator.py
```
